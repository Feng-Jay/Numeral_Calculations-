## Lab4: Direct solution of linear equations

- [x] Column principal element decomposition
- [x] LU decomposition method
- [x] Report

**To run this project**, You must use **python3** and stall library: **numpy**

**To checkout the outcome**:

Just enter the `column_main` and `LU_decomposition.py` run the code, then there will output the data and pictures.
