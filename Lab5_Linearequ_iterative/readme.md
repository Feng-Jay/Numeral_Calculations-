## Lab5: Iterative solution of linear equations

- [x] Gauss-Seidel iteration
- [x] SOR iteration method
- [x] Report

**To run this project**, You must use **python3** and stall library: **numpy**

**To checkout the outcome**:

Just enter the `Guass.py` and `Sor.py` and give the input values. Run the code, then there will output the results.
